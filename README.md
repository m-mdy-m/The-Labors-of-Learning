# about
This repository is a companion to my personal learning journey in the world of programming paradigms and techniques.

I will share everything that I think is important about these concepts in the form of links or if there are concepts that are difficult for me to understand, I will write and share them (probably in the form of an article). Also, I have my own learning list from GPT. I got 4 that you can see in this file. (If there is a problem, please fix it as a PR)

# follow
Feel free to follow my learning path and adapt it to your needs. Use the resources I discover and discover additional material to strengthen your understanding.
